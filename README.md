# CreatorHub.Brave - Secure Time-Locked Vault Platform

This project builds a secure, user-friendly launchpad platform that enables users to create personalized time-locked vault smart contracts on Ethereum Layer 2. Vaults hold ETH and selected ERC-20 tokens, unlock on a specified future date, and support gifting and social recovery.
